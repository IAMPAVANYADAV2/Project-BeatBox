# Project-BeatBox
Cyber BeatBox – Real-time Networked Java Beat Maker
Cyber BeatBox is a collaborative beat-making application written in Java using Swing, MIDI, and Socket programming. It lets multiple users create and share beats in real-time while chatting over a network. Built with a strong focus on concurrency, GUI interaction, and audio programming, this project is a practical demonstration of Java’s core capabilities.


🔑 Key Features
🎵 16×16 Checkbox Beat Grid – Design beats using 16 instruments across 16 time steps.

💬 Live Chat – Real-time chat between all connected users.

🔄 Server-Client Sync – Share your beat with others instantly using Java sockets and ObjectStreams.

⏱ Multithreaded Design – Smooth performance using concurrent threads for audio and network communication.

🎧 MIDI Playback – Built-in MIDI engine for accurate and responsive beat playback.

✅ Beat Maker UI

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 User Chat in Action

🔄 Beat Shared Across Clients

🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
Java GUI (Swing)

Java MIDI sound programming

Socket programming with ObjectInputStream / ObjectOutputStream

Multi-threading (UI thread, server thread, network listeners)

Realtime message + object syncing

MVC-style separation (to some extent)

🚧 Future Improvements
Add option to save/load beat sequences

Add volume and tempo controls

Add instrument sound previews

Convert to web version using WebSocket + Web Audio API (next-gen idea)
